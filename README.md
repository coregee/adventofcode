# Advent of Code 2024
Nothing fancy here, just having some fun. These are my personal solutions to AOC2024 in Python.
It's my first time actually doing one of these. You can participate too by visiting https://adventofcode.com/.

I'm not sure how hard these problems actually get, so I'm not really restricting myself from using built-in libraries or trying to write solutions in some old or low-level language.
